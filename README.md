#### ChatGPT Suggested Pitch (rewrite to make more personal after prototype is built)
"When I first walked into a recovery meeting, I had hit rock bottom. Like many of us, I had nothing but the hope of a better life. Each day, I passed by the donation jar, unable to contribute a single cent. There was no judgment, but it weighed on my mind. Today, I'm ___ months sober. While I still don't have much in the way of material wealth, I've gained something invaluableâ€”knowledge. During my recovery, I learned to code. This newfound skill inspired me to give back in a way that money couldn't. That's how I came up with the idea for _____, an app designed to help sponsees stay connected with their sponsors. With this app, daily check-ins are just a tap away, making the journey to sobriety a little bit easier for everyone."
